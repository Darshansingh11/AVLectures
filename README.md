# Unsupervised Audio-Visual Lecture Segmentation
Official repository for our paper, "Unsupervised Audio-Visual Lecture Segmentation", WACV 2023. 

## AVLectures
In this work we introduce, AVLectures, a large-scale educational audio-visual lectures dataset to facilitate research in the domain of lecture video understanding. The dataset comprises of 86 courses with over 2,350 lectures for a total duration of 2,200 hours. Each course in our dataset consists of video lectures, corresponding transcripts, OCR outputs for frames, and optionally lecture notes, slides, and other metadata making our dataset a rich multi-modality resource.

Courses span a broad range of subjects, including Mathematics, Physics, EECS, and Economics (see Fig. a). While the average duration of a lecture in the dataset is about 55 minutes, Fig. b shows a significant variation in the duration. We broadly categorize lectures based on their presentation modes into four types: (i) Blackboard, (ii) Slides, (iii) Digital Board, and (iv) Mixed, a combination of blackboard and slides (Fig. c shows the distribution of
presentation modes in our dataset).
